# TFG18
This repository contains part of the code used for the development of my TFG (Graduate thesis). It consists on developing a trading strategy for cryptocurrencies, by using different ML and AI methods. Although more research needs to be carried out, the algorithms provided here were proved to be able to beat the market, selecting the correct trading strategy based on them.
